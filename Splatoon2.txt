CRC32 is offset 0x10 len 0x483A0. bytes stored at 0x8, little-endian

Cmn::GetSaveWrite returns a ptr to save section objects as described below
_ZN3Cmn15SaveDataFactory6spDataE_ptr is the same ptr, sometimes directly used instead
these objects + 0x10 is the raw save data buf for that section
0x10: Header (offset 0)
0x18: SaveDataCmn   (save offset 0x10)
0x20: SaveDataVss   (save offset 0x2B220)
0x28: SaveDataLocal (save offset 0x37970)
0x30: SaveDataMsn   (save offset 0x3AD58)
0x38: SaveDataShop  (save offset 0x40BD0)
0x40: SaveDataCoop  (save offset 0x438D0)
0x48: SaveDataFes   (save offset 0x48290)

(offsets can be updated if they change by checking Cmn::SaveData::SaveData)

Header:
0x0: Product version? (0 for splatfest test, also seems totally unused)
0x4: DevelopVersion (0 for splatfest test, must match zero)
0x8: little-endian CRC32 of 0x483A0 bytes starting after header
0xC: Always zero?

SaveDataCmn:
0x00: Gender; 0 for girl, 1 for boy (gender is fake, but this u32 isn't)
0x04: HairId
0x08: BottomId
0x0C: SkinColorId
...
0x28: weapons, 0x100 0x130-sized entries. (first 0x20 of each is actual data, what's last 0x110?)
0x13028: Gear info, 3 blocks of 0x6000 size for each GearKind
    GearKind: 0x200 0x30-len entries
0x25038: SkillChips, 0x20 0x10-sized entries
0x25238: BoostTickets, 0x40 0xC-len entries
...
0x255E0: online_play_penalty:penalty_point
0x255E4: online_play_penalty:penalty_count
...
0x256F8: array of 0x80 bools
...
0x25778: money
0x2577C: "TurbanShell"
...
0x258A4: time_location_for_seq (string)

SaveDataVss: versus
0x00: Rank
0x04: Experience
0x08: StarRank
0x0C: 'UseBoost' (0xC bytes)
0x18: 'Udemae' data (skill?) at least 4 indexes
    0: ?
    1: udemae:cVgl
    2: udemae:cVar
    3: udemae:cVlf

SaveDataFest:
0x00: current FestId (-1 for no splatfest)
0x04: splatfest team (0 or 1)
0x08: Current splatfest level (e.g. fiend, champion)
0x0C: Current splatfest XP (within the above level)
0x10: Matches played
0x14: Current team power (32-bit float)
0x18: This is a flag bitfield. bit 4 (0x10) may indicate pre-splatfest voting time_location_for_seq
    - observed 0x33 during splatfest, 0x11 before
